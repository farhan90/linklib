This is a library to implement a linked list. The linked list contains a node of the structure:

struct node{
	void *data; // A generic data pointer
	struct node *next;
}


This structure can hold any generic data type.

The reason for implementing a linked list library is because its a very common
data structure that i use frequently for my project. So thought it would be
a good idea to just create a library in c for it.
